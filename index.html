        <h2>Your community has a heart beat</h2>
        <p>
          Every community has leaders, supporters, and hard workers. Sometimes a community has members that don't contribute helpfully, or worse are trying to damage what's being done. Sometimes you can't control who comes into your community.
        </p>

        <h2>Make sure that heart is healthy</h2>
        <p>
          Socialkardia is a set of digital social network awareness tools, much like developer CI tools. Socialkardia gives you a chance to know how your community is hurting and why it's hurting. Socialkardia gives you insight into people involved in your social network from Twitter, IRC, Reddit, or more.

            <h3>Scout</h3>
            <p>
              Scout is a passive analysis of social network profiles and personas. It can answer the following questions about an individual:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Does this person interact with toxic people? </li>
              <li> How toxic is this person? </li>
              <li> Has this person changed over time? </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Radar</h3>
            <p>
              Radar is a passive toxicity detection system for group discussion. It can be used as an alert system or simply as a histographic tool for these types of situations:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Someone in your group is being extra toxic. </li>
              <li> The discussion tempature is rising. </li>
              <li> Someone is continually being a toxic community member. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Backtrace</h3>
            <p>
              When alerts do trigger you'll use this tool to find out why and fine tune the array of methodologies we have at our disposal. This is also useful for catching red herring or false positives. It gives you these utilities:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Determine the toxicity of a piece of text. </li>
              <li> Store information about a particular user. </li>
              <li> Find the cause of spike points </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
